A lightweight, containerized system monitoring agent designed to demonstrate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and cloud-native integration. This project provisions an AWS ECR repository using Terraform, builds a Python-based monitoring agent, and pushes the immutable artifact to the cloud registry.
